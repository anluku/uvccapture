Description: USB UVC Video Class snapshot software
 The purpose of this software is to capture an image from a USB webcam at a
 specified interval, and save it to a JPEG file, no other formats are supported.
 .
 Right now this software is really a hack, since still image support is not yet
 available in the UVC driver. The program continually polls the UVC driver in
 MJPEG mode, and at a specified interval writes a JPEG header and a single frame
 to file, creating a JPEG image.
